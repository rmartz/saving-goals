  <p *ngIf="impedeGoal()">
    This cost is greater than this goal's currently saved balance, and borrowing the difference from other goals may result in the amount borrowed still being outstanding when they are fully funded. This could potentially delay other goals' purchase, even once fully funded.

    After purchase, this goal will be kept active until it is fully funded and the saved balance reaches the purchase cost.

    <em>Note:</em> The cost is greater than the available amount saved across all other goals for this budget.
